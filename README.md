### 
⚠️**Disclaimer**
- I’m releasing the project in its current state because I want to share the work publicly, even though it’s not fully finished. Due to limited time and capacity, I won’t be able to actively develop or maintain the app for now.

That said:
- 🧪 The app is stable enough for everyday use
- 🐛 Some features are incomplete or experimental
- 🤝 Contributions, forks, and feedback are very welcome

Thank you for trying WynnPedia and supporting this community tool!
